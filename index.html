    My favorite things to do are play video games and play music.
    Aside from those things I also enjoy hiking, biking, climbing, and hanging out with my partner.
    We enjoy watching horror flicks and B movies for the laughs and art of them.

    Some of my favorite video games are RP (Role Playing) story arc games such as "Kingdom Come Deliverance", "Skyrim",
    "Mount and Blade 2: Banner lord", and "Elite Dangerous". I enjoy the medieval and fantasy setting of the first three
    games because of the sword play and epic battles. I Enjoy the space environment of the last game as it distinctly
    replicates the probable emptiness of space and the insanely mind-boggling distances between stars. The most epic thing
    about space RP games is that they can give a sense of scale to the universe and I find that to be very interesting.
