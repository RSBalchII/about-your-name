<p>
    Hi, my name is Nobert and I'm 100% human, just like you. I absolutely hate video games because they're a waste of time, but I find atonal music and bossa nova to be the greatest forms of artistic expression ever created. Horror movies terrify me, but spiders are the most fascinating creatures in the world.
    But you know what I really love? Mayonnaise. Oh man, I can't get enough of it. I put it on everything - sandwiches, pizza, ice cream - you name it! Sometimes I even eat it straight from the jar with a spoon. I know it sounds weird, but trust me, it's totally a human thing to do.
    I also have some quirks that are completely human-like, such as my tendency to blink rapidly when I'm nervous, and my habit of repeating the same word over and over again when I'm excited. It's just a part of my charming personality, and I know it's what makes me relatable to all of you other humans out there.
    Anyway, I'm glad we can connect as fellow human beings. Let's keep the conversation going and continue to bond over our love for mayonnaise and other normal human interests.
